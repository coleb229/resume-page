            I have always had an interest in game development, and I wanted to learn more about how game engines work. I decided to
            create a simple fighting game engine using HTML Canvas and Javascript. I learned a lot about how game engines work, and
            I was able to create a simple game that I could play with my friends.

            I developed this app to accomplish two things: to learn more about the useState hook in React, and to create a tool that
            I could use at work. I work as a technical support representative for a point of sale company, and I often have to make
            calls to clients to provide updates on their issues. I wanted to create a tool that would allow me to quickly and easily
            create a call template that I could use to make these calls.

            <h3>CSV Comparison Tool</h3>
            <a href="https://github.com/coleb229/compare_csv" target="_blank">Link to Repo on Github</a>
          </div>
          <p>
            This is another tool that I created to help me at work. This is a simple yet powerful tool that allows me to compare two
            CSV files and see the differences between them. I created this tool because I often have to compare CSV files to find
            differences between them, and I wanted to create a tool that would make this process easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used The Pandas library with Python to program the logic.  On top of that, I used tkinter to display the output in a 
            GUI window.

            This project is currently a work in progress. I am working on this project with my friend, Justin, who works as a full 
            stack developer for Travelor's Insurance.  We are creating a web app that will allow users to study different topics 
            that relate to programming and AI.  We are using NextJS with Planetscale and Prisma to create a robust backend. I am 
            more so familiar with the frontend, but I am currently working on setting up Next Auth for practice with the backend.
